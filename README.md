# distsync: sync files from object stores to your servers.

`distsync` makes synchronizing files from an object store like S3 to your servers very easy. It is not intended for __personal__ use, instead it is the best damn way to sync tarballs to servers.

This means distsync is only optimized to move your application tarball or docker export from your CI, to a group of servers.  It can optionally use BitTorrent to accelerate delivery and reduce S3 costs.  

## Features

* _Simple_: Single command to upload from CI, easy daemon mode for servers.
* _Encrypted_: [AEAD Encryption](https://github.com/codahale/etm) of both file contents and file names.
* _Multi-Cloud_: Supports both AWS S3 and Rackspace Cloud Files as storage backends.
* _BitTorrent_: AWS S3 can optionally use BitTorrent to increase speed and reduce transfer costs.
* _Pluggable_: Contributions Welcome. New storage, encryption, and transfer plugins are welcome.

## Usage

1. distsync setup
	Answer propmts
	Creates ~/.distsync
	Creates ~/.distsyncd
1. Copy ~/.distsync to your uploader (eg, Jenkins).
1. Copy ~/.distsyncd to your servers.
1. Run `distsync daemon` on servers.
1. `distsync upload foo.tar.gz` on your uploader.
1. Voil√†! Your files are now on all your servers.


## What does this do?

* `distsync setup` creates two identities with limited permissions.  The first is for uploading, it allows distsync to upload to a single bucket.  The second is for downloading which gives it permissions to watch for notifications, list, and download from the bucket.
* `distsync upload` encrypts the specified file, uploads it to s3, and notifies servers it is available.
* `distsync daemon` watches for notifications, and on a new file being available will download it to the local path using BitTorrent and HTTPS from S3.


## Configuration File Reference

The configuration file is in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax.

### Example

```toml

SharedSecret = "<random-secret-here>"
StorageBucket = "distsync-503aa718-89cc-488c-ae82-0d8f6d08ed1c"
Encrypt = "AEAD_AES_128_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256"
Notify = "S3Poll"
Storage = "S3"

[AwsCreds]
  Region = "us-east-1"
  AccessKey = "<access-key here>"
  SecretKey = "<secret-key here>"
```
